# Using Enums as Flags in C#

Enums in C# provide a convenient way to define a set of named integral constants, making code more readable and manageable. But enums can do more than store individual values—they can also serve as _flags_, allowing combinations of values to be stored within a single variable using bitwise operations.

In this article, we’ll explore how to use enums as flags, how bitwise operators come into play, and why this approach can enhance flexibility and readability in your code.

## TL;DR
Here is a quick round up if you are too busy or too lazy to read all content. 

Using enums as flags allows you to combile enum values to represent combination of enums. 
1. Use [Flags] attribute in you enum to declare it as flag
2. Create flag values by combining enum values
```csharp
var readWritePermission = FilePermissions.Read | FilePermissions.Write;
```

## Setting Up Enums as Flags

In C#, marking an enum with the `[Flags]` attribute allows you to use it as a set of flags. Here’s a basic example:

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum FilePermissions
{
    None = 0,
    Read = 1,
    Write = 2,
    Execute = 4
}
```

With this setup, each value is represented by a power of two. This enables distinct combinations of values using bitwise operations like OR (`|`), AND (`&`), and NOT (`~`).

### Why Use Flags with Enums?

Flags-based enums are useful when you need to store multiple states in a single variable. For instance, file permissions might allow a user to read, write, and execute a file. Instead of creating separate booleans for each permission, a flags enum simplifies this into a single property.

## Using Bitwise Operators with Flags

Here’s how to combine and manipulate enum values:

- **OR (`|`)** combines flags.
- **AND (`&`)** checks if a flag is set.
- **XOR (`^`)** toggles flags.
- **NOT (`~`)** inverts all bits (use with caution).

### Example Usage

Consider a method that checks for specific permissions:

```csharp
FilePermissions permissions = FilePermissions.Read | FilePermissions.Write;

bool canRead = (permissions & FilePermissions.Read) == FilePermissions.Read;
bool canWrite = (permissions & FilePermissions.Write) == FilePermissions.Write;
bool canExecute = (permissions & FilePermissions.Execute) == FilePermissions.Execute;

Console.WriteLine($"Can Read: {canRead}");
Console.WriteLine($"Can Write: {canWrite}");
Console.WriteLine($"Can Execute: {canExecute}");
```

In this example, `canRead` and `canWrite` are `true`, while `canExecute` is `false` because the `Execute` flag was not set.

## Adding and Removing Flags

Flags can be added or removed by modifying the bits directly. Here’s how:

```csharp
// Add Execute permission
permissions |= FilePermissions.Execute;

// Remove Write permission
permissions &= ~FilePermissions.Write;
```

After these operations, `permissions` will contain `Read` and `Execute` but not `Write`.

## Benefits of Using Flags in Enums

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Flags condense multiple boolean values into a single enum variable.
2. **Improved Readability**: Enums clarify what each flag represents.
3. **Code Flexibility**: Flags allow easy addition or removal of values without redefining the data structure.

## When to Use Flags

Flags are suitable for scenarios with related binary states that may need combining or toggling. They are particularly useful in contexts like:

- Permission management (Read, Write, Execute).
- State tracking (Active, Pending, Inactive).
- Feature toggles in configuration settings.

## Conclusion

Using enums as flags in C# unlocks additional power in managing multiple, combinable states. By taking advantage of the `[Flags]` attribute and bitwise operators, you can write more concise, readable, and flexible code.

With these basics, you’re ready to use flags in enums effectively for your next project. Happy coding!
